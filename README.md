# CoffeeBrewer

This is my second personal project. I learnt how to use Core Data and basic filtering with predicates.

I got the idea for this project after making V60 coffee and seeing baristas tracking their brews. 
I decided to make an app that has a timer and you can rate the characteristics of each brew.
The history will be saved with Core Data and you can filter the coffees of specific brand.

The app is not polished.
